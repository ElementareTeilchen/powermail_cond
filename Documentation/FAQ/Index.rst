Q: What can I do if it does not work?
-------------------------------------

* Check if you use powermail 2.9.0 or higher (if not install this first)
* Check if jQuery Source and powermail_cond.js is loaded to the form page (HTML footer)
* Try to use powermail and PowermailCondition.js with default powermail html templates (some classes are needed)
* Deactivate all other JavaScript on the page for testing
* Note: Never deactivate any field or fieldset in the backend â€“ this will do powermail_cond
* Note: Use jQuery 1.11, 2.x or newer
